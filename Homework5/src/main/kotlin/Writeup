So far my standard matrix multiplication function matches the results of my Strassen's multiplication algorithm
function, so I can safely assume that they are both implemented correctly. I tested square matrices of sizes 4, 8, 20,
100, and 1000. At the smallest sizes standard matrix multiplication is much slower then the Strassen algorithm. As the
sizes got bigger the difference between runtime got smaller until the Strassen algorithm was slower then standard matrix
multiplication.
