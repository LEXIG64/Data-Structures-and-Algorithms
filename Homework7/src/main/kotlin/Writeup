I originally implemented my Lempel-Ziv encoder using lists instead of using my associative array. Using lists required
me to do more operations and class changing in my code that took entra steps and slowed down my runtime. Using the
associtaive array class I didn't need to have 5 lines of code writing out an operation to save my substring sequences,
instead it could be done in one line. Additionally this made sending information over to my decoding function a lot
easier because instead of having to reconstruct a an associative array from a list using indexes, I could just read off
the original reference number as a key. This also created less errors when saving my substrings because they were stored
behind a key to prevent unintentional indexing in my code that could cut or overwrite my substrings.
