 In a brief report, summarize the situations where k-d trees are superior to a brute force search.

K-D tree searches are superior to brute force searches when searching through a 100 or more coordinate points or when
the coordinate points are in a dimension of 4 or more. As size increases K-D tree searches are a 10th of the runtime of
brute force searches. As dimensional size of the coordinate points increases the difference in runtime is not as
extreme. When both dimensionality and number of points are larger then typical values the runtime of a nearest
neighbor search using K-D trees is exponentially faster then nearest neighbor brute force search.
